### Why 1D models?
- Testing ground for validity of approximate techniques developed for higher dimensional systems.
- helps in guessing properties of higher dimensional systems.
- some materials behave quasi 1D systems because of dominating inter-particle interactions along a chain of particles.
- there are classes of problems that can be mapped onto one-dimensional Ising-like models, such as the conformational equilibria of a linear polymer.
- the mathematical techniques employed to solve the problem are applicable to other types of problems.
- even the one-dimensional spin system must become ordered at T = 0, and therefore, understanding the behavior of the system as T â†’ 0 will be important in our treatment of spin systems via renormalization group methods.
